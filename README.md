Introduction: 
"The Local Express" is the Indian Cultural Newspaper. Our site tries to present wholesome information about the local vendors and artisans from different parts of India. We cater to the wide variety of consumer demands and expectations. In addition to being a information marketplace, the local express also promotes "Atmanirbhar Bharat" - promoting local Indian products, artform or handicrafts among the Indians. This is a small step towards building a self-reliant India. Promoting swaraj not only in terms of nation, but of the self.This is also an effort to reduce the turmoil of the local businesses in terms of marketing. Providing voice to them and making them accessible to a wider audience and propelling their business to great heights.
